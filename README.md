## Background
Indonesia is one of the largest coffee beans producer and exporter countries. Indonesia has a wide variety of coffee beans and each coffee bean has its characteristics. Here in Indonesia, coffee also has a huge amount of enthusiasm. Despite the big crowd and various types of coffee, it is still difficult to find a reliable source about the coffee quality. There is a need to have a source of information that covers different types of coffee related topics, such as brewing advice, roasting advice, etc. But, the question is, how can an app be developed to assess the quality of userâ€™s coffee beans and a comprehensive chatbot for coffee enthusiasts? 

Our plan is to make a feature on a mobile app that allows users to upload their image of coffee beans and let them know the quality of coffee beans, whether it is good or bad coffee beans. There will also be a chatbot that allows users to ask about coffee-related topics. Both planned features will be using 2 different machine learning models. By providing these functionalities, the app aims to enhance the coffee experience for enthusiasts and provide valuable insights and guidance in the world of coffee.

Each learning path has already developed solutions according to their job description, which are: 

1. **Machine Learning**: building both models with TensorFlow. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to make image classification models and implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the chatbot using DNN.
2. **Mobile Development**: Make a user-friendly design, and implement them into the application. Used Figma to make the mockup design, cooperate with the Cloud Computing team to prepare the APIs, and made the application based on the design with Android Studio using Kotlin.
3. **Cloud Computing**: Deployment of user-related and article-related APIs using NodeJS on Google Cloud Run, combined with Firebase for user authentication, Firestore Database to store user and article data, and Cloud Storage to store static data like images A classification model and chatbot made with Python have also been deployed with Google Cloud Run.
